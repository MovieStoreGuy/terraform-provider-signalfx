# Resource: signalfx_jira_integration

Splunk Observability Cloud Jira integrations. For help with this integration see [Integration with Jira](https://docs.splunk.com/observability/en/admin/notif-services/jira.html).

~> **NOTE** When managing integrations, use a session token of an administrator to authenticate the Splunk Observability Cloud provider. See [Operations that require a session token for an administrator](https://dev.splunk.com/observability/docs/administration/authtokens#Operations-that-require-a-session-token-for-an-administrator). Otherwise you'll receive a 4xx error.
